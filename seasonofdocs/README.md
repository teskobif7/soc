# Google Season of Docs 2021

Google [Season of Docs](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs) (GSoD) gives technical writers an opportunity to work with open source projects.

The CNCF is applying to participate in GSoD 2021!

## 2021 Timeline

In 2021 GSoD starts earlier and runs longer! Projects begin in April/May and run until November.

Project proposals include a new requirement for budgeting. For more information, see the [proposal template](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/docs/org-proposal-template). 

### Project proposals

CNCF project maintainers interested in mentoring a technical writer have until **March 14th, 2021** to submit a [documentation proposal](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/docs/org-proposal-template) for your CNCF project.

Well-scoped projects have:
- Clear scope: what will and won't a writer work on?
- Clear goals: when does the writer's work end?
- Clear metrics: how will you and the writer know you've succeeded?
- Clear budgeting: what are your project costs for a writer?

Complete your proposal by **March 14th, 2021.** Due to anticipated volume, projects submitted after March 14th may not be considered.

Please let the CNCF docs team know you're working on a proposal as soon as possible: 
- In the [#techdocs channel of CNCF Slack](https://app.slack.com/client/T08PSQ7BQ/CUJ6W5TLM?cdn_fallback=2)
- By email at [mentoring@cncf.io](mailto:mentoring@cncf.io)
