## Project Ideas

If you are a project maintainer and consider mentoring during the GSoC 2020 cycle, please, submit your ideas below using the [template](/PROJECT_IDEA_TEMPLATE.md).

For example:

### Prometheus (sample):

#### Refactor the APIs for better readability and less maintenance overhead

- Description: Currently the HTTP API is not very well organized and needs some tidying up. The actual course of action is not decided yet, but [go-kit](https://github.com/go-kit/kit) looks like a good fit.
- Recommended Skills: golang
- Mentor(s): Krasi Georgiev (@krasi-georgiev)
- Issue: https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/issues/3416

### Strimzi

#### Add support for changing a KafkaTopic's `replicationFactor`

- The [Strimzi](https://strimzi.io) project provides an easy way of running Apache Kafka on Kubernetes. It uses KafkaTopic custom resources to provide a cloud-native way of managing topics in a Kafka cluster. Strimzi also uses [Cruise Control](https://github.com/linkedin/cruise-control) to provide Kafka cluster balancing functions. This project would add support for changing a KafkaTopicâ€™s replicationFactor property by using Cruise Control.
- Recommended Skills: Java
- Mentor(s): Tom Bentley (@tombentley), Tom Cooper (@tomncooper)
- Issue: https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-operator/issues/191

### TiKV

#### TLA+ Specification for async commit

- The [TiKV](https://github.com/tikv/tikv) has recently been launching a new feature in the transaction model named [Async commit](https://github.com/tikv/sig-transaction/tree/master/design/async-commit). It's an optimization that reduces the commit latency from 2PC to 1PC. However, this feature has not been reflected in the [TLA+ Specs](https://github.com/pingcap/tla-plus/tree/master/DistributedTransaction). This project aims to update the spec and to run TLC model checker on the new model to gain more confidence in the async commit design.
- Recommended Skills: Go, Rust, TLA+
- Mentor(s): Ziqian Qin (@ekexium), Andy Lok (@andylokandy)
- Issue: https://github.com/tikv/sig-transaction/issues/97
