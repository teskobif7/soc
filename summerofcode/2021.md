## Project Ideas

If you are a project maintainer and consider mentoring during the GSoC 2021 cycle, please, submit your ideas below using the [template](/PROJECT_IDEA_TEMPLATE.md).

For example:

### Prometheus (sample):

#### Refactor the APIs for better readability and less maintenance overhead

- Description: Currently the HTTP API is not very well organized and needs some tidying up. The actual course of action is not decided yet, but [go-kit](https://github.com/go-kit/kit) looks like a good fit.
- Recommended Skills: golang
- Mentor(s): Krasi Georgiev (@krasi-georgiev)
- Issue: https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/issues/3416

### Kubernetes

#### Web-based Simulator for the Kubernetes Scheduler

- Description: [Kubernetes](https://k8s.io) (k8s) is a production-grade container-orchestration system. The [k8s scheduler](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/kube-scheduler/) decides which pods (containers) should go to which machines to be run. Not everyone has a running cluster lying around, so a web-based simulator that simulates the scheduler's behavior serves as an excellent interactive learning tool.
- Recommended Skills: Golang, Kubernetes
- Mentor(s): Adhityaa Chandrasekar (@adtac)
- Issue(s): https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/99605

### Strimzi

#### Add support for changing a KafkaTopic's `replicationFactor`

- The [Strimzi](https://strimzi.io) project provides an easy way of running Apache Kafka on Kubernetes. It uses KafkaTopic custom resources to provide a cloud-native way of managing topics in a Kafka cluster. Strimzi also uses [Cruise Control](https://github.com/linkedin/cruise-control) to provide Kafka cluster balancing functions. This project would add support for changing a KafkaTopicâ€™s replicationFactor property by using Cruise Control.
- Recommended Skills: Java
- Mentor(s): Tom Bentley (@tombentley), Tom Cooper (@tomncooper)
- Issue: https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-operator/issues/191

### TiKV

#### TLA+ Specification for async commit

- [TiKV](https://github.com/tikv/tikv) has recently been launching a new feature in the transaction model named [Async commit](https://github.com/tikv/sig-transaction/tree/master/design/async-commit). It's an optimization that reduces the commit latency from 2PC to 1PC. However, this feature has not been reflected in the [TLA+ Specs](https://github.com/pingcap/tla-plus/tree/master/DistributedTransaction). This project aims to update the spec and to run TLC model checker on the new model to gain more confidence in the async commit design.
- Recommended Skills: Go, Rust, TLA+
- Mentor(s): Ziqian Qin (@ekexium), Andy Lok (@andylokandy)
- Issue: https://github.com/tikv/sig-transaction/issues/97

#### High-performance data import tool

- [TiKV](https://github.com/tikv/tikv) currently lacks a robust tool to import great amount of data. But, in fact, TiKV has implemented [`sst_importer`](https://github.com/pingcap/kvproto/blob/3cd2fc5fad226caeffed72297e3e13a571f5592e/proto/import_sstpb.proto#L34) to fast import SQL data to TiDB by [`Lightning`](https://github.com/pingcap/br) tool. `Lightning` imports SQL data in two steps: translating SQL data in KV pairs and importing KV pairs into TiKV. By exposing the second steps, we can support importing KV-like data into TiKV, e.g. migrating from HBase to TiKV.

### CoreDNS

#### Add ACME protocol support for certificate management with DNS

- [CoreDNS](https://github.com/coredns/coredns) is a cloud-native DNS server with a focus on service discovery. While best known as the default DNS server for Kubernetes, CoreDNS is capable of handle many other scenarios within or outside of Kubernetes clusters for make easy infrastructure management. One such case is the certificate management. This project is to provide ACME protocol support so that it is possible to have automatic certificate management through CoreDNS. More details and discussions are available in https://github.com/coredns/coredns/issues/3460.
- Recommended Skills: Golang, DNS, TLS, Certificate Management
- Mentor(s): Yong Tang (@yongtang), Paul Greenberg (@greenpau)
- Issue: https://github.com/coredns/coredns/issues/3460

### Keptn

#### Provide a hub for Keptn integrations, extensions & services

- The [Keptn project](https://keptn.sh) is a cloud-native application life-cycle orchestrator, acting as a control-plane for different tools for deploying, testing, etc of your applications. Currently, Keptn services and integrations can be found on an overview page. While this served fine as a central overview of all currently supported integrations, a more sophisticated "integrations hub" is desired.
- Recommended Skills: Angular/TypeScript
- Mentor(s): Juergen Etzlstorfer (@jetzlstorfer)
- Issue: https://github.com/keptn/keptn/issues/3406

### Tremor

#### Add plugin support for tremor (PDK)

- Description: The PDK or (plugin development kit) aims to allow loading artifacts into tremor at runtime instead of requiring a full recompilation. This streamlines the development process of extending tremor with custom functionality. The goal is to allow live loading of a number of artifacts so start with: Pipeline Operators, Codecs, Pre- and Postprocessors, Custom Functions.
- Recommended Skills: rust, Linux
- Mentor(s): Darach Ennis (@darach), Matthias Wahl (@mfelsche)
- Issue: https://github.com/tremor-rs/tremor-runtime/issues/791

#### Add gRPC client and server support to tremor

- Description: gRPC is an industry-standard API abstraction and runtime. Currently, tremor supports interfacing with the outside world over WebSockets, HTTP/1.1, or target-specific connectors. Adding support for gRPC will allow generalizing a whole lot of client and server connections and making interfacing with other cloud-native applications easier. The goal of this project is to add support for such generic gRPC based services.
- Recommended Skills: rust, Linux, http/2, protocol buffers
- Mentor(s): Heinz Gies (@Licenser), Anup Dhamala (@anupdhml)
- Issue: https://github.com/tremor-rs/tremor-runtime/issues/790

### cert-manager

#### Improve the usability of cert-manager on multiple cloud providers

- [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io) is one of the most popular Kubernetes addons. It introduces Certificate Authorities and Certificates as custom resource types in the Kubernetes API, and enables automatically managed certificate rotation. While the most common use is publicly trusted ACME certificates for Ingress controllers, it can also be used to manage identites in service meshes such as Istio. The project is to improve the user experience of deploying cert-manager on different cloud providers, helping to diagnose, fix and recommend workarounds for any discovered issues.
- Recommended Skills: Golang, Infrastructure as Code
- Mentors: Jake Sanders (@jakexks), team-cert-manager@Jetstack
- Issue: https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/issues/3720

### LitmusChaos

#### Rewrite litmus portal authentication server and add third-party integration of Gmail and Github. 

- [LitmusChaos](https://litmuschaos.io) is a Kubernetes native chaos engineering framework that helps SREs & developers find weaknesses in their deployments, with the chaos intent being defined via custom resources. The goal of this project is to rewrite the authentication server to make it modular and lightweight. Also, add third-party integration of Gmail and Github. 
- Recommended Skills: Golang, Kubernetes, MongoDB.
- Mentors: Karthik Satchitanand (@ksatchit), Raj Babu Das (@rajdas98)
- Issue: https://github.com/litmuschaos/litmus/issues/2483

### Envoy
#### Adaptive Load Control and Distributed Load Testing of Envoy Data Planes

- Description: Users configuring their Envoy-based data planes don't know how to find the optimal Envoy configuration given their workload's resiliency and performance requirements. Nighthawk, Envoy's load generator, supports adaptive load control and horizontally distributed scaling of itself. Using distributed load testing and the creation of a set of adaptive load controllers, Envoy users can be empowered with repeatable tooling to automate identification of an optimal Envoy data plane configuration.
- Recommended Skill(s): Golang, C++, Rust
- Issue(s): https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy-perf/issues/72
- Mentor(s): Lee Calcote (@lcalcote), Otto van der Schaaf (@oschaaf)

### Open Service Mesh

##### Support for WebAssembly filters

-	Description: Bring OSM on par with other service meshes that support WASM filters in their data plane. OSM's Envoy proxies can be extended at runtime with filters that are running in a WebAssembly sandbox (https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy-wasm). Provide ability to dynamically load and unload Envoy WASM filters. Provide general purpose filtering of application infrastrcuture logic, tying business logic closer to the mesh.
-	Recommended Skills: golang, rust
-	Mentor(s): Lee Calcote (@leecalcote), Abishek Kumar (@kumarabd)
-	Upstream Issue (URL): https://github.com/openservicemesh/osm/issues/1671

### Service Mesh Interface
##### Support for Multi-Cluster Operations

- Description: Facilitate federation service mesh deployments across Kubernetes clusters, considering for service catalog federation and 
identity federation. Account for 1) multiple Kubernetes clusters using the same service mesh, 2) hetrogenius workloads (Kubernetes, VMs, Bare metal) using the same service mesh, 3) multiple Kubernetes clusters using different service meshes (e.g. Istio and Linkerd), 4) heterogeneous workloads using different service meshes (e.g. Istio, Consul).
-	Recommended Skills: golang, kubernetes, meshery, smi
-	Mentor(s): Lee Calcote (@leecalcote), Abishek Kumar (@kumarabd)
-	Upstream Issue (URL): https://github.com/servicemeshinterface/smi-spec/issues/212

### OpenEBS

#### Add support for updating mountpoints and capacity of devices using dmesg parser

- [OpenEBS](https://openebs.io/) is the leading Container Attached Storage solution. OpenEBS NDM exposes storage devices on the hosts as BlockDevice custom resources. The capacity and mountpoints of these devices can change dynamically on the host and openebs needs to update it in the custom resources, without doing a full reinitialization. The goal is to update this information by parsing dmesg and thus provide the latest information to the users.
- Recommended Skills: Golang, Linux
- Mentor(s): Akhil Mohan (@akhilerm)
- Issue: https://github.com/openebs/openebs/issues/3135 

### Prometheus

#### Implement configurable retention time for Prometheus series

- Description: Currently, Prometheus data is deleted after a configurable amount of time, or once the disk size reaches a configured limit. However, many users would like to keep some data, such as the result of recording rules or SLO data, for a longer period of time than higher cardinality raw data. The goal of this project is to allow users to configure Prometheus to configure the retention time on a per series basis.
- Recommended Skills: golang
- Mentor(s): Chris Marchbanks (@csmarchbanks), Bartlomiej Plotka (@bwplotka)
- Issue: https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/issues/1381

#### Port the Prometheus API to OpenAPI

- Description: Prometheus offers rest API of all sorts but they are not well
  documented. The idea would be to use OpenAPI to have self-documentation and
  specification files to be used by third parties. This would enable the use of
  Prometheus API's with clients from any languages easily.
- Recommended Skills: golang
- Mentor(s): Julien Pivotto (@roidelapluie)
- Issue: https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/issues/2392

### Thanos

#### Smart automation for project documentation and website

- Description: In Thanos we donâ€™t like manual work. Thatâ€™s why we try to automate as much as we can, ensuring our documentation is up to date, links are working and documentation works from both GitHub and Website. We want to consolidate our automation and scripts to separate projects called mdox, so itâ€™s working more reliably and helping other projects too! This project is to finish that work and allows students to have a great impact in the project tooling community. NOTE: This is a documentation tooling project, not related strictly to Thanos/Prometheus distributed systems - itâ€™s a great starting point for passionate person interested in working with Go and wanting a soft intro to Cloud Native project maintenance topics!
- Recommended Skills: golang
- Mentor(s):  Bartlomiej Plotka (@bwplotka)
- Issue: https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/issues/3081

#### Automated, Granular TLS client support in Thanos

- Description: Thanos Querier component supports basic TLS configuration for internal gRPC communication. This works great for basic use cases but it still requires extra forward proxies to make it work for bigger deployments. Itâ€™s also hard to rotate certificates automatically and configure safe mTLS. This project aims to remove those simplifications allowing better TLS story for all Thanos metrics APIs!
- Recommended Skills: go, distributed systems, TLS, gRPC
- Mentor(s):  Bartek Plotka (@bwplotka), Kemal Akkoyun (@kakkoyun)
- Issue: https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/issues/977


### Crossplane
#### Upgrade OAM Implementation in Crossplane to Latest Release of Spec

- Description: [Crossplane](https://crossplane.io) is an open source Kubernetes add-on that supercharges your Kubernetes clusters enabling you to provision and manage infrastructure, services, and applications. Under the hood, it leverage Open Application Model to define and ship applications across clusters in an developer centric approach. Currently, the [implementation in Crossplane is OAM spec v0.2.1](https://github.com/crossplane/oam-kubernetes-runtime) and didn't fully reflect the latest release of upstream specification. This proposal will help Crossplane catch up with the latest change.
- Recommended Skills: Golang, Kubernetes
- Mentor(s): Ryan Zhang (@ryanzhang-oss), Sun Jianbo (@wonderflow)
- Issue(s): https://github.com/crossplane/oam-kubernetes-runtime/issues/321

### Cloud Native Buildpacks
##### Lifecycle Prepare Phase

-	Description: A Lifecycle Prepare phase should make it easier for platforms to achieve parity with features of Pack. Today, features like [`project.toml`](https://buildpacks.io/docs/app-developer-guide/using-project-descriptor/) are only supported by Pack, and a new platform would need to write itâ€™s own parser. This project would include design (writing an RFC), specification (updating the CNB spec), and implementation (writing the code for the phase in [Lifecycle](https://github.com/buildpacks/lifecycle)).
