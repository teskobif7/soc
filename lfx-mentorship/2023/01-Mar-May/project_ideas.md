## Proposed Project ideas

### Cluster API Provider GCP (CAPG)

#### Add telemetry and profiling support

- Description: Cluster API Provider GCP (CAPG) enables the creation of Kubernetes clusters in GCP with Cluster API. With increasing adoption of Cluster API (CAPI) in general and of CAPG we want to improve the supportability of CAPG, especially for production environments. The first part of this is to add telemetry/tracing using OpenTelemetry so that we can understand and visualize the flow of reconciliation within the provider. The next part is to add a **pprof** endpoint that can be optionally enabled to enable operations/support users to collect profiling information from a running instances of CAPG.
- Expected Outcome: This work will enable tracing and profiling of a running instance of CAPG (along with supporting docs) to supports operations/support engineers.
Recommend Skills: Golang, Kubernetes
