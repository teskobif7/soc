## Proposed Project ideas

### Kubernetes

#### Cluster API Provider GCP (CAPG)

##### Add telemetry and profiling support

- Description: Cluster API Provider GCP (CAPG) enables the creation of Kubernetes clusters in GCP with Cluster API. With increasing adoption of Cluster API (CAPI) in general and of CAPG we want to improve the supportability of CAPG, especially for production environments. The first part of this is to add telemetry/tracing using OpenTelemetry so that we can understand and visualize the flow of reconciliation within the provider. The next part is to add a **pprof** endpoint that can be optionally enabled to enable operations/support users to collect profiling information from a running instances of CAPG.
- Expected Outcome: This work will enable tracing and profiling of a running instance of CAPG (along with supporting docs) to supports operations/support engineers.
Recommend Skills: Golang, Kubernetes
Mentors(s): Carlos Panato (@cpanato), Richard Case (@richardcase)

### KubeVela

#### Extend the capability of KubeVela by making several useful addons

- Description: KubeVela currently have a variety of addons , including experimental options, that address scenarios such as Continual Delivery and observability. To further enhance the out-of-box functionality for users of KubeVela, we can offer additional useful addons.
- Expected Outcome: 10+ eperimetal addons, clear documentation should be provided for enabling and using these addons, including examples of useful use-cases.
- Recommended Skills: golang, kubernetes, cueLang
