#### TBD


#### Chaos Mesh

##### Chaos Engineering as a Service

-	Description: Chaos Mesh is not like Chaos Engineering as a Service now:
    - Poor observability: the result of chaos experiments are not easy to observe and judge, the users need to check whether the Chaos effects by manual.
    - [Chaosd](https://github.com/chaos-mesh/chaosd)(for physic node) is too simple: only supports command line operation, does not support task scheduling and life cycle management.
    - The costs of learning operation and maintenance are high: the maintenance of Chaos Mesh and Chaosd are not unified.

    It should a unified place to manage Chaos experiments for multiple platforms and multiple clusters, and can see the monitoring data of the experiment.

-	Recommended Skills: Golang
-	Mentor(s): Wang Xiang (@[WangXiangUSTC](https://github.com/WangXiangUSTC))
-	Upstream Issue (URL): https://github.com/chaos-mesh/chaos-mesh/issues/1462

### SIG Usability
#### Jobs-to-Be-Done study

Qualitative analysis of user interview recordings for Jobs-to-Be-done study

- Description: SIG Usability is conducting a Jobs-to-Be-Done study meant to identify the highest impact areas for improving Kubernetes UX. We are in the process of conducting user interviews and need some help going back through the transcribed recordings to annotate and pull out insights from the conversations. Overall, this is a great opportunity for someone whoâ€™s studied or engaged in UX/IA/Usability to get involved in open source.
- Recommended Skills: User Research, UX, synthesis
- Mentors: Gaby Moreno (@morengab), Tasha Drew (@tashimi)
