CNCF Mentoring Initiatives
==========================

The Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) participates in a variety of mentoring programs. CNCF is a great place to spend a summer learning, coding, participating and contributing. We are an exciting open source foundation with a vibrant community of projects, and we look forward to your application and your project ideas!

Organization Admins
-------------------

If you need help with anything mentoring at CNCF, you can file an issue or contact one of the admins below:

-	Chris Aniszczyk ([@caniszczyk](https://github.com/caniszczyk)\): https://twitter.com/cra
-	Ihor Dvoretskyi ([@idvoretskyi](https://github.com/idvoretskyi)\): https://twitter.com/idvoretskyi

Communication
-------------

Please reach out to us on the #mentoring channel on the [CNCF slack](https://slack.cncf.io/).
Please don't use DMs unless strictly necessary as doing so both has the potential of overwhelming project maintainers and others with similar questions lose the benefit of public discussion.

It's best if you use a public communication channel whenever possible; however, if you need to communicate in private, please feel free to send the admins a note via soc@cncf.io (please use the public channels for any project-related discussion).
