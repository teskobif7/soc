# CNCF + Summer of Code

The Cloud Native Computing Foundation participates in Google's Summer of Code (GSoC). CNCF is a great place to spend a summer learning, coding, participating and contributing. We are an exciting open source foundation with a vibrant community of projects, and we look forward to your application and your project ideas!
