##### Refactor the APIs for better readability and less maintenance overhead

- Description: Currently the HTTP API is not very well organized and needs some tidying up. The actual course of action is not decided yet, but [go-kit](https://github.com/go-kit/kit) looks like a good fit.
- Recommended Skills: golang

### OpenTelemetry

#### OpenTelemetry C++ SDK ETW exporter

-	Description: Add exporter for ETW (Event Tracing for Windows) as one of the optional recommended exporters that languages may decide to implement as part of SDK. Initial set of languages to support: C++ and/or C#. ETW exporter allows any open source project running on Windows (e.g. Docker) to leverage OpenTelemetry C++ SDK, emitting telemetry events (traces, logs) over ETW channel. Subsequently a listener Agent may forward events to fluent, ELK stack, or other destination. For example, events may be transformed and forwarded OTLP protocol collector. Min-bar is to implement the necessary OT C++ SDK changes (C++) and a test listener (C#). Additional scope may include some concrete examples of instrumentation: Docker ETW logs driver, or an additional out-of-proc forwarder from ETW provider listener to OTLP receiver. Simple projection for node.js (console log to OT C++ SDK - ETW) may also be designed, time-permitting.
-	Recommended Skills: some C++ or C# coding experience. Windows development environment is needed.

#### OpenTelemetry SDK PHP Exporter
   -   Description: Develop some of the exporters for PHP that are found in the ([Spec Compliance Matrix](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/master/spec-compliance-matrix.md#exporters)) that are not yet completed for PHP.  There are some really neat exporter implementations that would be excellent candidates for creation / improvements:
      - OTLP (priority)
      - Zipkin
      - Jaeger
      - Prometheus
- Recommended Skills: PHP

### TiKV

#### Support ENUM / SET push down for TiKV Coprocessor

-	Description: Coprocessor is a TiKV component to handle predicate push down. This task is to add `ENUM` and `SET` data type to it, so that the performance can be improved in scenarios that involve with these two data types.
-	Recommended Skills: Rust, Database
