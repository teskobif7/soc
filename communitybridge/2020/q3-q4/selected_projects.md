##### Refactor the APIs for better readability and less maintenance overhead

- Description: Currently the HTTP API is not very well organized and needs some tidying up. The actual course of action is not decided yet, but [go-kit](https://github.com/go-kit/kit) looks like a good fit.
- Recommended Skills: golang

### Opentelemetry

#### ETW exporter

-	Description: Add exporter for ETW (Event Tracing for Windows) as one of the optional recommended exporters that languages may decide to implement as part of SDK. Initial set of languages to support: C++ and/or C#. ETW exporter allows any open source project running on Windows (e.g. Docker) to leverage OpenTelemetry C++ SDK, emitting telemetry events (traces, logs) over ETW channel. Subsequently a listener Agent may forward events to fluent, ELK stack, or other destination, like OTLP protocol collector. Min-bar is to implement the necessary OT C++ SDK changes and a test agent. Additional scope may include concrete example of instrumentation (Docker ETW logs driver), an additional out-of-proc forwarder from ETW provider listener to OTLP receiver, or a simple projection from node native module to OT C++ SDK.
-	Recommended Skills: some C++ or C# coding experience. Windows development environment is needed.
